== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Why should I use WP-TwitterAnalytics?

Because it leverages the power of WordPress to store real-time Twitter data in a WordPress MySQL database 
and lets you publish analysis and results in a blog post. WP-TwitterAnalytics goes directly to the source using 
the Twitter Search API to collect data. Twitter data is also made available for download and offline analysis.

Is there a limit to data monitoring?

You can monitor up to 5 keywords and phrases, hash tags (#), stock tweets ($) or users(@) at any given time. 
There is no limit on how many tweets that can be stored online.

Can I monitor Tweets when my WordPress dashboard is closed or I am not online? If not, why?

No, your web browser must be open with WP-TwitterAnalytics running in order to monitor and 
record data. WP-TwitterAnalytics is a very powerful, high-throughput tool that can monitor, store and 
records tens of thousands of tweets (or more) during any session. Having the tool running continuously for 
high tweet volume topics could crash a WordPress blog if it is not configured to handle massive amounts of data. 
By limiting the number of queries and ensuing that a user is aware of monitoring and recording conditions 
dramatically reduces the likelihood of a server crash.

What is the difference between WP-TwitterAnalytics and other social media monitoring tools?

WP-TwitterAnalytics only monitors tweets from the Twitter Search API. It does have, however, 
many of the same features provided in the social media monitoring and analytics tools on the market 
today such as share of voice analysis, tweet monitoring, recording and online storage, and download 
to CSV functionality.
